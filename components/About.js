        Founded in 2022 by a group of book enthusiasts, Book Store has come a long way from its beginnings as a small local bookstore. When we first started out, our passion for reading drove us to do tons of research, so that Book Store can offer you the world's best book selections. We now serve customers all over the world and are thrilled to be a part of the quirky, eco-friendly, fair trade wing of the book industry.

      <p>The Book Haven Team</p>
